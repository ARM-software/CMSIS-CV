# OpenCV

Pre-compiled [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) static libraries for running in the browser. Those libraries have been generated with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emsdk.html)

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) page is explaining how to rebuild the library for the web.

It is only used for tests and comparison with the CMSIS-CV kernels in the browser.

OpenCV is covered by its own license and copyright information is included in the folder.

It is a separate project from CMSIS-CV and just included here for convenience to make it easier to rebuild the tests.
